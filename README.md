###### skipping Storybook because it may outweigh its benefits

- [ ] [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react-native/en/get-started/)
- [ ] strict design system with storybook

###### Versions

```
java
  openjdk 11.0.20 2023-07-18 LTS
  OpenJDK Runtime Env Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
  versions > 11 can give errors

nodejs: v16
```

###### Checks before running

- [ ] android/local.properties -> check os and user-name
- [ ] adb and android studio
- [ ] cd ios && pod install && cd ..

```
the following code (in package.json) takes care of linting and formatting the code pre-commiting
  "lint-staged": {
    "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --ext .tsx --ext .ts src/ --fix"
    ],
    "./src/**": [
      "prettier --write ."
    ]
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  }
  "commitlint": for checking the commit

```
